# Shell scripting notes from Datacamp

pwd = current working directory
cd  = change working directory i.e cd /home/repl
cp  = copy files
mv  = move files
rm  = remove files(not directories) IMPORTANT: before removing double check is needed as there is no undo. 
rmdir  = remove directories only when directory is empty for safety of work purposes. 

**If a directory starts with / then it is absolute path. Otherwise it is a relative path.**
